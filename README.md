# README

This is basically a poor (wo)man's Pac-Man. I decided to name it after a poorly written YA novel/movie to seem more original (which, in hindsight, doesn't make a lot of sense). The goal is to collect all 7 "treasures" (gold tiles) in as short a time as possible, then exiting from the green tile.
